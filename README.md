## 👋 Hi all!
### I'm a **Software Engineer** with ~2.5 years of experience.  

Beyond software development, I have a strong passion for **Philosophy** and **Languages**.

Throughout my career, I've been working in the sphere of **Frontend Development**. I spent the majority of it speciallizing in **Vuejs** and its ecosystem.

I'm basically here to learn and interact with open source software, driven by curiosity and passion to make the world, or at least a portion of it, a better place.
